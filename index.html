            <p id="p1">When I was in first grade my first school was SK Putrajaya Presint 8(1), but unfortunately I studied for only 3 months since I 
                have to move to Dubai. I then studied there for 4 years at an international school call Gems Wellington Primary School, there
                I met and get to know a lot of friends and teachers from other countries.When I came back to Malaysia I continue to finish my
                primary days at SK Putrajaya Presint 16(2).

            <p>I studied at SMK Putrahaya Presint 16(1). The school is located in Putrajaya Presint 16 near Alamanda.
                I was a student here from 2016-2021.Its just a normal school not a boarding school.It's a nice school and I sure do
                miss this school a lot.I took science stream during secondary and managed to get 6As and 3Bs for SPM

            <p> I then continued my studies to IIUM CFS at gambang. This was my first studying far from home and I like it so much
                .I had an amazing time at CFS, I get to know a lot more people from other states and be friends with them. Currently,
                 I am still enrolled at IIUM, but at Gombak and am currently transitioning from the 
                 first year to the second year of my degree.
